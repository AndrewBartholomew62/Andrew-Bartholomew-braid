              A. Bartholomew's Braid Programme 25.1 - source distribution

Extracting the archive should have resulted in the creation of a directory 
braid-25.1 in the directory to which the archive was extracted.

If you just want to run the programme, first try the Makefile supplied in the, 
prog directory, which should build the programme into that directory. Just type 
'make' (but without the quotes) to build the programme.  You may then wish to 
type 'make clean' (again, no quotes) to remove the object files the compilation
produces.  The Makefile is based on the gcc compiler and is not sophisicated, 
I can't guarantee it will work on every system, so you'll need to ask a local 
system expert for help if it doesn't work properly.

If you are interested in the source code, it is all in the src and include 
subdirectories of prog.

The doc directory contains a copy of the user documentation and software 
developer notes, both in html format.  

The directory braid-25.1/prog contains a file called inputfile, this is a sample 
input file for the braid programme, see the user documentation for a description
of this file.
