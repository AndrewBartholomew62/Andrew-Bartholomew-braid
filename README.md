# braid-programme

The braid programme was originally written to calculate matrix representations of virtual braid groups. It has evolved to include 
tasks that relate to virtual knots, long knots, welded knots and knotoids but that do not involve a braid representation. However, 
in the absence of anything better, the name 'braid' has been retained for the programme.

The tools provided by the programme support the following:

    Alexander and Burau polynomial invariant
    Alexander-like polynomial invariant of a classical doodle
    Burau, or generalized Alexander, polynomial invariant
    Commutative automorphism switch invariants
    Finite-switch polynomial invariants (also known as rack polynomials)
    Fixed-point invariant of the braid representation of a knot or doodle
    Matrix-switch polynomial invariants
    Quaternionic polynomial invariants
    Sawollek's normalized Conway polynomial for a braid word
    Weyl algebra switch polynomial invariants

    Arrow polynomial of a classical or virtual knot, link, long knot, long virtual knot, knotoid or multi-knotoid
    HOMFLY polynomial
    Jones polynomial of a classical or virtual knot, link, knotoid or multi-knotoid
    Kauffman's Affine Index Polynomial for virtual knots or knotoids
    Kauffman bracket polynomial of a classical or virtual knot, link, knotoid or multi-knotoid
    Turaev's extended bracket polynomial of a classical or virtual knotoid or multi-knotoid
    Parity arrow polynomial of a classical or virtual knot or knotoid
    Parity bracket polynomial of a classical or virtual knot or knotoid

    Dynnikov test for the trivial braid
    Hamiltonian circuits within classical or flat knot or link diagram

    Labelled immersion code for a braid word
    Labelled peer code for
        braid word of a classical or virtual knot or link
        labelled immersion code of a classical or virtual knot or link
        Gauss code of a classical, virtual or flat link, knotoid, multi-knotoid or multi-linkoid
