# braid-programme

The braid programme was originally written to calculate matrix representations of virtual braid groups. It has evolved to include 
tasks that relate to virtual knots, long knots, welded knots and knotoids but that do not involve a braid representation. However, 
in the absence of anything better, the name 'braid' has been retained for the programme.

The tools provided by the programme support the following:

    The Alexander and Burau polynomial invariants of a classical or virtual knot or link
    The Alexander-like polynomial invariant of a classical doodle
    Various quaternionic polynomial invariants of a classical or virtual knot or link
    Various matrix-switch polynomial invariants of a classical or virtual knot or link
    Various Weyl algebra switch polynomial invariants of a classical or virtual knot or link
    Various finite-switch polynomial invariants (also known as rack polynomials) of a classical or virtual knot or link
    The fixed-point invariant of the braid representation of a knot or doodle
    Various commutative automorphism switch invariants of a classical or virtual knot or link
    Vogel's algorithm for determining a braid word from a classical or virtual knot or link diagram
    The HOMFLY polynomial for the closure of a classical braid
    The Kauffman bracket polynomial of a classical or virtual knot, link, knotoid or multi-knotoid
    The Jones polynomial of a classical or virtual knot, link, knotoid or multi-knotoid
    Turaev's extended bracket polynomial of a clasical or virtual knotoid or multi-knotoid
    The arrow polynomial of a classical or virtual knot, link, long knot, long virtual knot, knotoid or multi-knotoid
    Manturov's parity bracket polynomial of a classical or virtual knot or knotoid
    Kaestner and Kauffman's parity arrow polynomial for classical and virtual knots or knotoids
    Kauffman's Affine Index Polynomial for virtual knots or knotoids
    Sawollek's normalized Conway polynomial for a braid word
    The Dynnikov test for the trivial braid
    The Dowker(-Thistlethwaite) code for the braid
    The Gauss code, or the oriented or unoriented left preferred Gauss data for a labelled peer code, labelled immersion code or a braid word
    The labelled immersion code for a braid word
    The labelled peer code for a braid word or a labelled immersion code
    The labelled peer code for the Gauss code of a classical link
    The labelled peer code for the r-parallel cable satellite of a knot's peer code
