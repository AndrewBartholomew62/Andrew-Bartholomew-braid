# braid-programme

The braid programme was originally written to calculate matrix representations of virtual braid groups. It has evolved to include 
tasks that relate to virtual knots, long knots, welded knots and knotoids but that do not involve a braid representation. However, 
in the absence of anything better, the name 'braid' has been retained for the programme.

The tools provided by the programme support the following:

    Alexander and Burau polynomial invariant
    Alexander-like polynomial invariant of a classical doodle
    Burau, or generalized Alexander, polynomial invariant
    Commutative automorphism switch invariants
    Finite-switch polynomial invariants (also known as rack polynomials)
    Fixed-point invariant of the braid representation of a knot or doodle
    Colouring number invariant for virtual knots, links or doodles
    Cocycle state sum invariants including the doubled-birack cocycle invariant
    Birack polynomial invariants based on colouring numbers or cocycles
    Matrix-switch polynomial invariants
    Quaternionic polynomial invariants
    Sawollek's normalized Conway polynomial for a braid word
    Weyl algebra switch polynomial invariants
