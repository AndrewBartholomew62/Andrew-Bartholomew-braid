<h2><a name="Debugging"></a>2. Debugging information</h2>

<p>Version 11.1 introduced a structured debug subsystem across classes and the main braid function.  Prior to this, various booleans controlled debug output but only a subset of them were accessible from the command line.  The debug subsystem allows full debugging control as well as default debug options in a flexible and extensible manner.
</p>

<p>Debug information is requested using the <kbd>#</kbd> option, followed optionally by a debug specification enclosed in square brackets <kbd>[]</kbd>.  The debug specification is a list of options, separated by colons; an option may be followed by one or more option parameters, enclosed in braces <kbd>{}</kbd> and also separated by colons.  No spaces are permitted in a debug specification.  Thus the general format is of the form:</p>

<p STYLE="margin-left: 1cm">
<kbd>braid -#[option:option{parameter:parameter}:option]</kbd>
</p>

<p>If no debug specification is given then the default programme debug options are set.</p>

<p>The available debug options can be displayed by running the braid programme with the both the debug option and the hidden help option described above:</p>

<p STYLE="margin-left: 1cm">
<pre>
[bart@wormwood current]$ braid -#H!

    debug options may be specified using the syntax -#[option:option{parameter:parameter}:option]
    supported options and parameters:
            bigint{san:+:-:*:/:%:rs:ls:bc:==:gt:out:in:sum:diff:num_len:gcd:all}, bitmap: no default
            matrix{det:inv:*:all}, bitmap: no default
            poly{no-gen:san:+:*:/:in:gcd:all}, bitmap: general debug included unless no-gen specified
            rational, boolean
            quaternion, boolean
            braid{summary|1:basic|2:intermediate|3:detail|4}, integer: default 0=off, no parameters sets summary
            vogel, boolean
    default options set by omitting [...]
    default options:
            braid{summary}

</pre>
</p>

<p>Each option corresponds to a class (bigint, matrix, etc.) or a functional area of the programme (braid, vogel).  As can be seen from the above output, there are currently three different types of debug control used by the debug options: bitmap, integer and boolean each of which is described below.  The option parameters for each of the classes are set by the function <kbd>set_debug_option_parameter</kbd> in the file <kbd>debug.cpp</kbd> and for the braid programme specific options by <kbd>set_main_debug_option_parameter</kbd> in the file <kbd>main.cpp</kbd>.</p>

<p>A bitmap debug control variable requires parameters to specify what debug information is required, as an example the bigint_control structure is defined as follows:</p>

<p>
<pre>
struct bigint_control
{
    static unsigned int DEBUG; //bitmap
    enum parameters
    {
        general =     0x00000001, // unused
        sanitize =    0x00000002, 
        add =         0x00000004,
        subtract =    0x00000008,
        multiply =    0x00000010,
        divide =      0x00000020,
        remainder =   0x00000020,
        equal =       0x00000040,
        greater =     0x00000080,
        output =      0x00000100,
        input =       0x00000200,
        sum =         0x00000400,
        diff =        0x00000800,
        num_len =     0x00001000,
        r_shift =     0x00002000,
        l_shift =     0x00004000,
        bool_conv =   0x00008000,
        gcd =         0x00010000,
        // 'all' also supported
    };
};
</pre>
</p>

<p>An integer debug control variable defines different levels of debug information to be provided, as in the case of the braid programme's debug control structure:</p>

<p STYLE="margin-left: 1cm">
<pre>
struct braid_control 
{
    enum level {OFF, SUMMARY, BASIC, INTERMEDIATE, DETAIL};
    static int DEBUG;
    static bool VOGEL_DEBUG;
};
</pre>
</p>

<p>Finally, a boolean debug control variable, the simplest form of debug control, requires no parameters an example being <kbd>VOGEL_DEBUG</kbd> in the <kbd>braid_control</kbd> structure above.  The debug control subsystem is mainly coded in the separate source file <kbd>debug.cpp</kbd>, though the braid programme specific debug information is contained in <kbd>main.cpp</kbd>.</p>

<p>Debug output is written to the file braid.dbg in the current directory, it is formatted as a list of records that indicate the source of the debug information.  Here is a sample debug output when reading the string <kbd>2x-1</kbd> into a <kbd>polynomial&lt;quaternion&lt;scalar&gt; &gt;</kbd> using the <kbd>biging</kbd> scalar variant, the debug option used to generate this output was <kbd>-#[poly{in}:bigint{in}:quaternion]</kbd>.</p>

<h2><a name="Polynomials"></a>3. Polynomial storage mechanism</h2>

<p>Polynomials are defined here to be doubly-linked lists of pterm structures, headed by a polynomial structure 
that points at the start of the list.  Each pterm structure corresponds to one term of the polynomial, with only
non-zero terms being stored, the number of terms currently held is recorded in the length field of the polynomial 
structure that points to this list </p>
 
<p>The polynomial structure also contains information about the number of variables in the polynomial, and the 
variable characters used and whether those variables are mapped to another object.  These definitions do not limit 
the number of variables, nor the particular choice of variable characters, but the characters i,j,k,I,J,K should be 
avoided since polynomials may involve quaternions.</p>
 
<p>The actual definitions are:</p>

<p><pre>
template &#060;typename T, typename V=string, typename U=int> class polynomial
{
    int         nv;          /* number of variables */
    char*       vc;          /* string of variable characters */
    int*        vd;          /* array of (maximum absolute) variable degrees */
    map&#060;char,V> vm;          /* variable map */
    U           l;           /* length of virtual array of pterms */
    pterm&#060;T,U>* p;           /* pointer to first term of polynomial */
    static polynomial&#060;T,U> add_pterm (polynomial&#060;T,U>&, pterm&#060;T,U>*);

    /* operators etc */
};

template &#060;typename T, typename U>	struct pterm
{
    T         n;      /* coefficient */
    U         pl;     /* place in canonical order - counted from zero */
    pterm*    prev;   /* pointer to previous term */
    pterm*    next;   /* pointer to next tern */
};

</pre></p>


<p>Polynomials are taken here to be elements of the ring of Laurent polynomials with coefficients in the ring indicated by T, 
generated by the stated variables and their inverses.  The coefficients may be a built in ring type (int, long, complex etc.) 
or one of the <A HREF="#Scalar-classes">scalar classes</A> implemented by the braid programme code.</P>

<p>Optionally, variables within a polynomial may be mapped to an object of type V, allowing polynomials involving variables 
of arbitrary type to be handled. The motivating cases were the arrow polynomial, which requires variables \Lambda_i and K_i 
(strings rather than characters) and the parity bracket polynomial, which includes graphical nodes as variables.  These 
non-character variables are mapped to proxy character variables in order that the existing code may be re-used, with the mapped 
type being used for variable comparison and output.</p>

<p>When two polynomials include variable mappings, their mapped variable objects are used for comparison purposes.  The 
implementation does not require that the character used as a proxy for a mapped variable is always the same. 
Thus, if in x+y the variable x is mapped to an object V and in y+z the variable z is mapped to the same V, then 
these two polynomials are considered to be the same.  Similarly, the code distinguishes between variables in a polynomial
that are unmapped and the same variable character in another polynomial that is mapped.  Thus, if P_1 = x and P_2 = x (x mapped to V),
then P_1 + P_2 = x + a (a mapped to V).  As in this example, mapped variable characters are replaced with others, rather than changing
unmapped variable characters.</p>

<p>When writing a polynomial with mapped variable to an output stream, the control boolean SUBSTITUTE_MAPPED_VARIABLES 
is used to determine whether the proxy characters or the mapped object is displayed.  If the boolean is false, then 
the output of the above polynomial x+y would appear as "x+y (x,V)" to indicate the variable mapping, whilst if the 
boolean is true, the polynomial would appear as "x+V", using the output operator for the object type of V.</p>

<p>At most one variable in a polynomial may be mapped to a given V, an attempt to map a subsequent variable to the same V
replaces the mapping of the existing variable with the new variable.<p>
 
<P>The polynomial structure stores the absolute degree of each variable, in the 
same order as the variable characters are stored.  Thus, for the polynomial  
<kbd>x^2y^-3+xy</KBD>, the absolute degree of <kbd>x</kbd> is 2 and that of <kbd>y</kbd> is 3.</P>
 
<P>The zero polynomial is represented by any polynomial structure with a null list 
pointer.  Unit polynomials have no variables, or degrees.</P>
 
<P>The pterms also contain a pointer to the previous and next pterm in the list: 
the first pterm in the list will contain a NULL previous pointer,
and the last a NULL next pointer.</P>
 
<P>The pterms do not store the variables to which the coefficients apply, instead we store the place the pterm has in a virtual array of pterms. This is list of 
polynomial terms based on a canonical ordering of the variables and which is described below.  Many of these terms will be zero, which is why we store the 
place in the list; it also provides a simple mechanism for determining where in a list a pterm should be stored, which is necessary when we start adding or 
multiplying polynomials.</P>

<p>The place in the virtual pterm list, and the length of the pterm list is indexed by a unit type U, which defaults to an integrer.  This allows us to define 
very large polynomials involving huge numbers of virtual pterms by setting U to be a <A HREF="#Scalar-classes">bigint</A>.</p>
 
<P>The canonical order of terms is in increasing order based on the exponent of the 
variables, which may be either positive or negative.  For a single
variable polynomial, this order is </P>
 
<p STYLE="margin-left: 1cm"><kbd>x^0, x^-0, x^1, x^-1... x^n, x^-n,</kbd></P>
 
<P>the reason for the <kbd>-0</kbd> exponent is due to the place calculation described below.  
Stick with it, these horrible looking things are never actually stored, remember 
we are talking about virtual pterms, we are only interested in the place in the 
list of the terms we want to store.  For a two variable polynomial, the 
canonical order is:</P>

<p STYLE="margin-left: 1cm"><kbd> 
     x^0y^0, x^0y^-0, x^0y^1, x^0y^-1, ...,x^0y^n, x^0y^-n...

<br> x^-my^0, x^-my^-0, x^-my^1, x^-my^-1, ...,x^-my^n, x^-my^-n...
</kbd></P>

<P>We are assuming here that the absolute exponent of <kbd>x</kbd> is <kbd>m</kbd> and the absolute 
exponent of <kbd>y</kbd> is <kbd>n</kbd>. A three variable polynomial example will enable us to see 
how to calculate places, consider an additional variable <kbd>z</kbd> of absolute exponent 
<kbd>k</kbd> and think of the number of terms we are writing down.</P>

<P>There are a total of <kbd>2(m+1)*2(n+1)*2(k+1)</kbd> entries in the list altogether.</P>
 
<P>Given a variable place <kbd>p</kbd>, in the range <kbd>0,...2(m+1)*2(n+1)*2(k+1)</kbd>, by looking at 
the integer part of <kbd>p/2(m+1)</kbd>, we can tell which block the variable place lies 
in, and therefore the power of the variable <kbd>x</kbd>.  If the block number is odd, the 
power is a negative one, otherwise a positive one, by dividing the block number 
by <kbd>2</kbd> and taking the integral part we determine the power of <kbd>x</kbd> of the variable 
stored in place <kbd>p</kbd>.</P>
 
<P>We now take the remainder of <kbd>p/2(m+1)</kbd>, which indicates the offset into the block 
of place <kbd>p</kbd>.  We can now work recursively, dividing this offset by <kbd>2(n+1)</kbd> to 
determine the power of <kbd>y</kbd> and then finally the power of <kbd>z</kbd>.</P>
 
<P>To calculate the place corresponding to a particular set of variables, simply 
work backwards through this calculation.</P>
 
<P>Thus to calculate the exponents from a place <kbd>pl</kbd>, we have code of the form:</P>

<p>
<pre>
    factor = poly.l;
    place = pl;
    for (i=0; i&lt;poly.nv;i++)
    {
        factor /= (2*(poly.vd[i]+1));
        if ((place/factor)%2)
            negative_exp = TRUE;
        else
            negative_exp = FALSE;
     
        power = place/factor/2;
        if (negative_exp)
            power *= -1;
     
        aexponent[i] = power;
        place %= factor;
    }
</pre>
</p>

<P>and to calculate a place:</P>
 
<p>
<pre>
    place = 0;
    factor = l;
    for (i=0; i&lt;poly.nv;i++)
    {
        factor /= 2 * (poly.vd[i]+1);
        block_num = 2 * abs(exponent[i]);
        if (exponent[i] < 0)
            block_num++;
        place += block_num*factor;

<h2><a name="Local-classes"></a>4. Local classes</h2>

<p>As the code has evolved, local classes for things like quaternions, rationals, matrices  big integers and  big-rationals have been developed.  These have been written 
because "standard" implementations were not available, to ensure I had control over the code, or just as an exercice.  However, I have made no attempt to replace them with "standard" implementations as they have become available, to minimize risk in making code changes.</p>

<p>In particular, the local <kbd>scalar</kbd> class has been developed to allow run-time selection of an object's type.  This class is documented on the <a href=http://www.layer8.co.uk/maths/scalars.htm>scalars</a> page of my website.</p>


<h2><a name="Comments"></a>6. General source comments</h2>


<p>I lay out my code in a way that I find easy to read, quick to debug and aesthetically pleasing (to me).  It is 
	not quite standard but it is, I hope, clear.  My style of writing evolved from working with ALGOL68 many moons 
	ago, so as an example, I always write</p>
 
<p>
<pre>
    char*  foo;
    char** bar;
</pre>
</p>
 
<p>rather than</P>
 
<p>
<pre>
    char &nbsp; *foo,**bar;
</pre></p>
 
<p>because ALGOL68 would write</P>
 
<p>
<pre>
    REF CHAR     foo;
    REF REF CHAR bar;
</pre>
</p>

<p>and I like the ability to look down the left side of the page and see what type of variable I have.  Also, as in all the above code snippets, I do not open clauses with a brace at the end of a line, rather I always put delimiting braces on their own line.  This is again motivated by ALGOL68 and I find it easier to look down code whose indentation
delimiters are vertically aligned.  Sorry if you find this weird.</p>

<p>You will find lots of comments in my code, which I hope will be useful if you use any of it for your 
own work.  I would be very happy to provide assistance to anyone trying to understand what I've done, provided I have the time.  Email me <a href="mailto:andrewb@layer8.co.uk">here</a> if you are experiencing problems understanding what I've done.</p>

<p>You are very welcome to use any of my source code in your programmes, but bear in mind that although it is provided in good faith and to the best of my knowledge the code is accurate, if you decide to use this software then I accept no responsibility for the consequences of any errors it may contain.  That said, it would be nice if you included a comment to say where you got it, and sent me an email to say you've used it, just so I get some feedback regarding how useful it actually is!</p>
