;                          Input file for braid programme version 26.0


; An input file may contain one or more braid definitions together with
; comments.  Comments are indicated by starting the line with a semi-colon
; as demonstrated by these lines. It is also possible to place a comment
; after a braid definition line, as shown in the braid definition example
; below.

; The file may contain lines of whitespace

; if a line contains only the word 'exit' after comments have been removed then 
; the processing of the file terminates at that point.

; see the user documentation for full details of the file format

; Titles
; ======

; A line beginning with '--' is used as a title for the switch, braid or code data and is reported
; in the output of the programme.  This is useful when a file contains multiple switches or 
; input data.  When reading the input file for the next switch or input data the programme records 
; any titles it encounters, the last of which is associated with the next switch or data input line 
; it finds.


; Quaternion switches
; ===================

; these are the sample switches from the quaternion invariants paper
; note the syntax quaternionic switches use the t variable by default
; use the -V option to disable this behaviour

-- Budapest switch
;S = (1,1,0,0) (0,0,-1,0) (0,0,1,0) (1,1,0,0)   ; this is the default quaternionic switch
;S = (1,1,0,0) (0,0,-1,-1) (0,0,1/2,1/2) (1,1,0,0)
;S = (1,1,0,0) (0,0,1/2,1/2) (0,0,-1,-1) (1,1,0,0)

; remove the semicolon to make these switches active
;S = (1,1,0,0) (-1,1,1,-1) (-1/4,1/4,-1/4,1/4) (1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2)
;S = (1,1,0,0) (1,-1,1,-1) (1/4,-1/4,-1/4,1/4) (1/2,1/2,-1/2,-1/2)
;S = (1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2) (-1/4,1/4,-1/4,1/4) (-1,1,1,-1) (1,1,0,0)
;S = (1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2) (1/4,-1/4,-1/4,1/4) (1,1,-1,-1) (1,0,1,0)
;S = (1,1,0,0) (-1,1,0,-1) (-1/3,1/3,0,1/3) (1/3,1/3,2/3,0)
;S = (1,1,0,0) (1,-1,0,-1) (1/3,-1/3,0,1/3) (1/3,1/3,-2/3,0)


; Matrix switches
; ===============

; matrix switch E1, this is the default matrix switch
; note there is no t variable specified here

; Note: polynomial variables should be specified in lower case
; S = 2, 0, x, 2, y, z, xyz-2y^2-2/2z, xz-2y/2

; matrix switch E2, this takes a LONG time to process
; S = a, 0, 0, a/a-1, b, c, b^2+a-1/c-ca, b/1-a

; if you want to include the t variable, use the syntax
; S[t] = a, 0, 0, a/a-1, b, c, b^2+a-1/c-ca, b/1-a


; Finite switches
; ===============

; Example essential virtual, welded or doodle pair switches.  Here a space is used to separate matrix elements from each other and the 
; leading D, F, T and W flags but any separator is acceptable, provided it does not contain S, F, T, or W.  The programme 
; skips any number of non-digit characters and reads the next matrix element.  This allows TeX output (for example) to be 
; pasted into an input file.

; a finite biquandle for use with classical braids, if this switch is applied to a virtual braid, the default twist is used
; S = F U(0,0) U(0,1) ... U(n,n) D(0,0) ... D(n,n)	
; 

; a finite biquandle for use with virtual braids with an alternative twist biquandle: S is specified first T second
; S = FT U(0,0) U(0,1) ... U(n,n) D(0,0) ... D(n,n) U(0,0) U'(0,1) ... U'(n,n) D'(0,0) ... D'(n,n)	

; a finite biquandle for use with welded braids with an alternative twist biquandle: S is specified first T second
; a switch for use with welded braids has to be a significant pair.
; S = FTW U(0,0) U(0,1) ... U(n,n) D(0,0) ... D(n,n) U(0,0) U'(0,1) ... U'(n,n) D'(0,0) ... D'(n,n)	

; a finite doodle pair, where S is a doodle switch (S has order 2 and S-Yang-Baxter is not satisfied) and 
; T is a finite quandle or biquandle.
; S = FDT U(0,0) U(0,1) ... U(n,n) D(0,0) ... D(n,n) U(0,0) U'(0,1) ... U'(n,n) D'(0,0) ... D'(n,n)	


; Commutative automorphism switches
; =================================

; Commutative automorphism switches are determined by two commuting automorphisms, phi and psi, of an abelian group
; the switch specification is atually a specification of phi and psi, as two nxn matrices, given row by row, with
; phi specified first.  
; Commutative automorphism switches are identified by the introductory phrase "S = A"; thus if 
; phi = diag(x,y) and psi = diag(z,w) we write:

; S = A x,0,0,y,z,0,0,w
; S = A a,b,0,a,x,y,0,x

; Weyl algebra switches
; =====================

; Weyl algebra switches are specified in one of the following forms:
  
; S = WP,n,p	the prime Weyl switch, U and V are nxn and p is a prime dividing n
; S = WT,n,p    the truncated polynomial Weyl switch, U and V are nxn and p is a prime dividing n
; S = WQ,n [,p]  the quantum Weyl switch, see notes below for the interpretation of p in this case
; S = WUV,p, u(0,0), u(0,1), ..., u(n,n), v(0,0), ..., v(n,n)	a custom Weyl switch, calculated mod p 
; S = WQUV,p, u(0,0), u(0,1), ..., u(n,n), v(0,0), ..., v(n,n)	a custom quantum algebra representation
; S = WUVG,p, u(0,0), u(0,1), ..., u(n,n), v(0,0), ..., v(n,n)	take GCD of the Delta_1 generators' numerator 
; S = WQUVG,p, u(0,0), u(0,1), ..., u(n,n), v(0,0), ..., v(n,n)	take GCD of the Delta_1 generators' numerator

; The specification of a prime p is required in each case other than the quantum Weyl algebra switch, where
; it is optional.  If no prime is specified for the quantum algebra the integers are used in place of Zp.
; The custom Weyl algebras allow for explicit specification of the matrices U and V, in which case the value
; of n is determined from the number of matrix elements provided.
; 
; Note that in the case of the custom quantum algebra representation, the specification of p is required so there is 
; no ambiguity between p and u(0,0), set p=0 if integers are required rather than Zp. A separate 'Q' version of the 
; custom specification is necessary because the checks made on the algebra are different in the quantum case 
; (e.g. UV-qVU=1 not UV-VU=1).  We cannot rely on p=0 to identify the quantum case as we want to allow Zp calculation 
; with a custom quantum algebra.

; Weyl algebra polynomial invariants are evaluated as rationals in the form n/d, where n and d are polynomials. 
; In some cases the polinomials are in a single variable and the generators of Delta<sub>1</sub> always yield d 
; as a unit. In these cases the programme can evaluate the greatest common divisor of the numerators of the E_1
; generators to give a single polynomial for Delta_1.  This option is specified by including 'G'in the 
; specification of the custom Weyl algebra.

; Titles
; ======

; A line beginning with '--' is used as a title for a switch, braid, or peer code and is reported
; in the output of the programme.  


; Braid definitions
; =================

; In this context a braid definition is an optional list of assignment
; statements followed by a braid statement.

; An assignment statement uses one of the eight word variables, w1,...w8
; provided by the programme.  It may assign to the word variable a string
; including elements of the form si, -si and ti for some i, or may reference
; other word variables either positively (wi) or negatively (-wi).
; Referenced word variables are expanded automatically.

; Here are some valid assignment statements:
; w1 = s1s2t3-s1-s2
; w2 = s2w1s2w1
; w3 = -w1-w2w1w2

; The interpretation of a negative word is the inverse of that word, so that
; in the above

; -w1 is the word s2s1t3-s2-s1 (note that the inverse of ti is again ti).

; A braid definition ends with a braid statement, which is simply a line with
; no assignment.  A braid statement may reference word variables used
; previously in the same definition.  Each new braid definition in the file
; starts with all word variables set to the null string.

; Here are some examples of braid statements

; -w3-w4w3w4
; -w3s1s2t3-s2-s1w3
; s1s2s3

; Here are some examples of braid statements with qualifiers
; Currently supported qualifiers are: "doodle", "welded", "flip", "invert", "plane-reflect", "line-reflect", "double" and "rack-terms=n".

; s1s2s1s2s1s2s1s2{doodle}; requires that the braid be treated as a doodle (with flat crossings)
; -w3s1s2t3-s2-s1w3 {welded}; requires that the braid be treated as a welded knot
; s2s1t3-s4 {flip} ; renumber the braid strands in the opposite order before processing this braid, produces s3s4t2-s1.
; s2s1t3-s4 {invert} ; reflect braid in a vertical line before processing this braid, produces s4t3-s1-s2.
; s2s1t3-s4 {line-reflect} ; reflect braid in a horizontal line drawn south of the braid before processing this braid, produces -s3-s4t2s1.
; s2s1t3-s4 {plane-reflect} ; reflect braid in the plane of the diagram before processing this braid, produces -s2-s1t3s4.
; s1-s2-s1t2s1s2-s1t2 {rack-terms=6}; calculate fixed-point invariants by adding sequentially s3, s4, s5, s6, s7, and s8

; Once a braid statement is encountered, the programme checks that braid
; then returns to the input file to check for another braid definition.

; Care must be taken to define a word variable in an assignment statement
; before it is referenced by another assignment statement or a braid
; statement.

; Here is the braid definition of Bigelow's example used to prove the Burau 
; representation is not faithful for n=5

;-- The Bigelow braid

;w1=-s3s2s1s1s2s4s4s4s3s2                 ; here is a comment after a line.
;w2 =-s4s3s2-s1-s1s2s1s1s2s2s1s4s4s4s4s4
;w3=-w1s4w1
;w4=-w2s4s3s2s1s1s2s3s4w2
;-w3-w4w3w4

; Labelled peer codes
; ===================

; Labelled peer codes are writen as a list of odd-numbered peers enclosed in square brackets to distinguish
; the code from a labelled immersion code.  Peers of type 1 crosings are written as negative numbers, 
; peers of type 2 crossings are written as positive numbers.  The peers are followed by a
; '/' character and the labels associated with each crossing 

-- k10n37
[-11 -17 19 13 -3 -15 5 -1 -9 7]/+++-++-+++

; Here's a link showing how different the peers of naming edges lying in different components
; are separated with commas

--l7a1
[-11 9, -3 1 -13 5 -7]/+++++++

; Labelled peer codes may be specified with a qualifier in a similar manner to braid statements.
; Two qualifiers are currently supported, the shift vector that specifies that the labelled peer
; code is to be renumbered according to the specified shift:

-- renumbered link
[-11 9,-3 1 -13 5 -7]/ + - - + - + - {shift[0,2]}

; and the satellite qualifier that replaces the peer code (which must be that of a knot, K) with 
; a satellite link formed of r parallel copies of the unknot in a torus, and companion knot K

[3 5 1]/+ - * {satellite=3}

; shift vectors move the start of the numering for each component forwards by the absolute amount of the
; given shift, negative shift components indicate orientation reversal.

; Labelled immersion codes
; ========================

; Labelled immersion codes have been deprecated by labelled peer codes but continue to be 
; supported for backwards compatibility.  They are writen as a product of cycles followed by a
; '/' character and the labels associated with each crossing.  Type 1 crosings are written as 
; negative numbers and type 2 crossings are written as positive numbers.

; Long knots
; ==========

; Long knots are specified as labelled immersion codes prefixed with an L
; The point at infinity may be moved around the immersion by a number of semi-arcs
; by specifying a + (forwards) or - (backwards) after the L together with the number of
; semi-arcs to move.  The direction is with respect to the orientation determined by the code.

;-- the fly
;L:(0 2 1)/- + *

;-- the dead fly
;L:+2(0 2 1)/+ - * ; infinity moved forwards two arcs

;-- the dead fly
;L:(0 2 1)/+ - * ; infinity moved backwards two arcs

;L:+2(0 4 2)(1 3)/+ - * + + ~ L:-3(0 4 2) (-1 -3)/+ + - + * ~ L:(0 4 2)(1 3)/+ * - + -


; Knotoids
; ========

; A knotoid K is specified as labelled immersion codes for the corresponding knot K_ by
; labelling the semi-arc containing the leg of the knotoid as zero and proceeding from the
; leg to the head.  There is a unique semi-arc entering the first shortcut crossing as an
; under arc with respect to this orientation, so that first crossing is identified in the
; immersion code by writing a ^ charcater *after* the corresponding crosing.

; Gauss code
; ==========

; Here is an example Gauss code for a link
;-- Gauss code example

; Gauss codes may also be specified in the following form
; O1-O2-U1-U3+O4-U2-O5+U6-O7-O3+U5+U4-U7-O6-

; Gauss codes for flat virtual links are specified using left and right indications

; Gauss codes for doodles are similarly specified using left and right:

; Dowker-Thistlethwaite codes
; ===========================
